    "\n",
    "**Arrays** are the major basic data structure in the python\n",
    "\n",
    "These arrays are used to store the **same data type** under it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of the array is **variable length** because it can change its length\n",
    "\n",
    "In python we can create array with the help of using the **list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider **list as an array**\n",
    "\n",
    "The list contains many **built-in methods**\n",

    "## **Insertion Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Append** \n",
    "- It will add the single value or collection data type as a single value and it will add at the **last**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Extend**\n",
    "- It will add the **only collection data type** and extract each and every elements and append them into the **last**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Insert**\n",
    "- It will insert the value based on the **index position**.\n",
    "- If the index position is large then it will add at the **last**\n",
    "- If the index position is small it will add at the **first**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Pop**\n",
    "- It is used to delete the **last element** one at a time.\n",
    "- It will take the **one non-mandatory argument** which is index position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Remove**\n",
    "- It is used to delete the element based on the **value**.\n",

    "## **TYPES OF ARRAYS**\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrays are classified into **two types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ONE DIMENSIONAL ARRAY**\n",
    "2. **TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRAY**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. One Dimensional Array**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the arrays which stores the elements in the **single sequence**. Each elements are accessed by using the **single index** which is starting from **0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Two Dimensional Array**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the arrays which stores the elements in the form of **row and column** similar to grid or matrix. To access the particular elements it always requires the **two index values** - one is for **row** and another is for **column**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr = [[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "       [5, 9, 7],\n",
    "       [44, 53, 23]]\n",

ARRAYS
Arrays are the major basic data structure in the python
These arrays are used to store the same data type under it.
The length of the array is variable length becz it change its length
In python  we can the array with help of  using the list.
We consider list as an array
Inside list e have so many built in methods

Insertion methods 
Append -> it will add the single value or collection data type as a single value and it will adds at the last.
Extend -> it will add the only collection data type and extract the each and every elements and append them in to the last
Insert -> it will be insert the value based on the index position. If the index position is large then it will add at the last or if the index position is  small it will add at the first.

Deletion method
Pop -> it is used to delete the last element  one at a time.
It will take the one non mandatory argument which is index position.
Remove  -> it is used to delete the element based on the value .
If the value is not present it will throw an error.

TYPES OF ARRAYS
the array  are classified into two types
1.ONE DIMENSIONAL ARRAY
2.TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRAY

1.one dimensional array
these are the arrays which stores the elements in the single sequences. Each elements are accessed by 
using the single index which is starting from 0 .
ex arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,8]

2. two dimensional arrays
these are the arrays which is stores the elements in the form of row and column similar to grid or matrix
 to access the particular elements it always required the two index values one is for row and another is 
 for columns.
 ex 
 arr=[[1,2,3],
      [5,9,7],
      [44,53,23]]
